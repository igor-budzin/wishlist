# API URL (OPTIONAL)
# ============================================
# In development: API calls are proxied through Vite dev server (see vite.config.ts)
# The proxy automatically forwards /api/* requests to http://localhost:3002
#
# In production:
# - Same-origin deployment (frontend served by Express): Leave empty (default setup)
# - Separate deployment (frontend on Vercel/Netlify): Set to backend URL
#   Example: VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourapp.com
#
# Note: Vite only exposes env variables that start with VITE_ to the client
