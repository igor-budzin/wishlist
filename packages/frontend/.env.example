# ============================================
# API URL (OPTIONAL)
# ============================================
# In development: API calls are proxied through Vite dev server (see vite.config.ts)
# The proxy automatically forwards /api/* requests to http://localhost:3002
#
# In production:
# - Same-origin deployment (frontend served by Express): Leave empty (default setup)
# - Separate deployment (frontend on Vercel/Netlify): Set to backend URL
#   Example: VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourapp.com
#
# Note: Vite only exposes env variables that start with VITE_ to the client
VITE_API_URL=""

# ============================================
# NOTES
# ============================================
# - Environment variables in Vite must be prefixed with VITE_ to be exposed to the client
# - Never store secrets or sensitive data in frontend environment variables
# - Frontend env variables are embedded in the build and visible to users
# - Changes to env variables require a dev server restart
